          Hello! My name is Eric Crain. I am currently a student at Vanderbilt University's Web Developer Coding Bootcamp. I am originally from Memphis, TN, but moved to East Tennessee to go to college. I received a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science degree from The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2015 with the goal of becoming a Physical Therapist. I worked in the healthcare field for an orthopadeic group in their Physical Therapy department as a Physical Therapy Technician from 2014 to 2020. PT school was not in the cards for me so I took on a new venture. I am currently the Shipping Manager of a wholesale plant nursery where I facilitate and oversee the shipping and receiving of plants of various types and sizes and plant products such as containers, ground cloth, fertilizer, etc. I have always been interested in web development though. In fact, it was one of my three choices when I was choosing a major for my undergraduate degree, and looking back now I know it is what I was meant to choose all along.
