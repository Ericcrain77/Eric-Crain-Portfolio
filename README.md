# Eric-Crain-Portfolio

In this portfolio, you will find usage of HTML, CSS, and a couple lines of JavaScript. The webpage should be responsive to different devices. The links should all be in working order.

## HTML
The majority of the functions are written in this language

## CSS
All of the stylings of the webpage are written in this language.

## JavaScript
The only thing written in this language is onclick functions for the different project images under the 'Work' subheading.
